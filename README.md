# Reasoning for Using AJAX with jQuery

In this project, we chose to use the AJAX method provided by jQuery ($.ajax()) for the following reasons:

## Ease of Use and Familiarity
The $.ajax() method from jQuery is widely used and familiar to many developers. It offers a simple API for sending asynchronous HTTP requests, which is ideal for making updates to data without refreshing the page. This method handles various types of requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and simplifies working with APIs.


## Support for JSON Data
The $.ajax() method allows easy configuration for sending JSON data. 

## Success and Error Handling
Using $.ajax() simplifies error handling and provides a callback structure for both success and error cases:


## Support for Asynchronous Operations
AJAX inherently supports asynchronous operations. By using $.ajax(), we can send the request in the background without blocking the UI. This allows users to continue interacting with the form or other parts of the page while waiting for the request to complete.

## Compatibility with [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
The choice of $.ajax() was also influenced by the nature of the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), which works perfectly with HTTP methods such as GET, PUT, and POST. The $.ajax() method allows seamless integration with these API endpoints and helps in handling responses from the API (such as post data and custom fields) efficiently.

## Conclusion
In this project, we chose the $.ajax() method provided by jQuery due to its simplicity, ease of use, and robust error handling. It helps us interact with the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) efficiently, handling both the core functionality (updating posts) and custom user input (adding custom fields). While newer alternatives like the Fetch API are available, jQuery AJAX offers a familiar, cross-browser solution that ensures smooth operation for all users.
